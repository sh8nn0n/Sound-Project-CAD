This  is one part of my science fair project for next year (which I am continuing from last year). 
This CAD project aims to create a pomelo peel-inspired soundproof device using different lattice structures. To do so, I CADded a bunch of different lattices (some not so successfulas others) to understand how these structures interacts with sound and motion while I continued my research. I got my references for the different types of lattices from
3D-Printed Lattice Structures for Sound Absorption: Current Progress, Mechanisms and Models, Structural-Property Relationships, and Future Outlook (Li et al.) https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202305232
